<div class="wrapper wrapper--content">
    <p><strong>Stylesheets and scripts are injected automatically while building</strong>, and only get optimized in <code>--production</code> mode. Working with development libraries instead of minified and production-ready code not only enables you to read through the code, but it also makes it easier to debug possible errors.</p>

    <hr id="view-specific">
    <h2>View-specific assets</h2>
    <p>This method is <strong>great for shrinking per-page asset size on larger projects</strong>. If you want to include a script or a stylesheet exclusively on a certain page, you can use the &quot;view-&quot; prefix. Just make sure the file name starts with &quot;view-&quot;, followed by the name of the page you want it on&mdash;eg. <code class="language-none">view-index.scss</code> or <code class="language-none">view-profile-some.library.js</code>&mdash;and you&#39;re good to go.</p>


    <hr id="exclude">
    <h2>Excluding files</h2>
    <p>Not the most useful feature development-wise, but you can exclude files by prefixing their name with an <strong>underscore</strong>, eg. <code class="language-none">_jquery-1.11.0.js</code>. This comes in handy when you want to commit a file that isn&#39;t quite ready yet, to a repository that you are working on with someone else. This way you can be sure it won&#39;t get in the way when the other persons builds the project on his machine. It also enables you to easily switch libraries in or out without the need to quit and restart the Headstart process.</p>


    <hr id="dependencies">
    <h2>Script dependencies</h2>
    <p>Scripts are <strong>automatically ordered alphabetically, and based on their location</strong> in the &quot;assets/js&quot; folder:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The library, i.e. any &quot;ender*&quot; or &quot;jquery*&quot; prefixed file from the <code class="language-none">assets/js/libs</code> folder.</li>
        <li>All files of <code class="language-none">assets/js/libs/dev</code> (only when not building <code class="language-none">--production</code>).</li>
        <li>All the other files of <code class="language-none">assets/js/libs</code>.</li>
        <li>All the files of <code class="language-none">assets/js/core</code> (if present).</li>
        <li>All the remaining scripts, including <code class="language-none">assets/js/main.js</code>.</li>
        <li>The view-specific scripts (if provided).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>By <strong>prepending a simple comment inside of your files</strong>, it is possible to define specific dependencies within this order. Say you are working with <code class="language-none">libA.js</code> which needs <code class="language-none">libZ.js</code> to work correcly. To make sure <code class="language-none">libZ.js</code> is injected first, prepend the following to <code class="language-none">libA.js</code>:</p>
    <pre class="language-javascript"><code>// requires: libZ.js

/* 
Other code from libA here ...
*/</code></pre>
